## TODO

- [x] how should SHADOW be deployed to enable this sort of orchestration? docker, service, etc? -> a multi-stage Docker file (first build, then lightweight runtime)
- [x] create a moodboard of designs (preferably ASCII art, it's really pretty)
- [ ] basic menu panel
- [ ] SHADOW integration
- [ ] live implant panel (live/dead GHOSTs)
- [ ] [EXTRA] builder for GHOST payloads
- [ ] [EXTRA] local cache (preferably a database; would be nice if it also cached requests)
